  <p> I prematurely shot my wad on what was supposed to be a dry run..so now I'm afraid I have something of a mess on my hands. You might wanna lean away from that fire since you're soaked in alcohol. Perhaps an attic shall I seek. I made a huge tiny mistake. I've always been deeply passionate about nature. Perhaps you remember Neuterfest? M: I'll never forget your wedding. I've been in the film business for a while but I just can't seem to get one in the can. I don't want no part of yo' tight-ass country club, ya freak bitch! A flower in my garden, a mystery in my panties.</p>
  <p> Let's make Ann the backup, okay? Very good way to think about her, as a backup. Heyyyy uncle father Oscar. Heyyyyyy Uncle Father Oscar. I'm an ideas man, Michael. I think I proved that with "Fuck Mountain." I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard. Stop licking my hand, you horse's ass. The only thing more terrifying than the escaped lunatic's hook was his twisted callâ€¦ Heyyyyy campers! I've used one adjective to describe myself. What is it?</p>
